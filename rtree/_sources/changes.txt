Changes
..............................................................................

0.7.0: 2011-12-29
=================

- 0.7.0 relies on libspatialindex 1.7.1+.
- int64_t's should be used for IDs instead of uint64_t (requires libspatialindex 1.7.1 C API changes)
- Fix __version__
- More documentation at http://toblerity.github.com/rtree/
- Class documentation at http://toblerity.github.com/rtree/class.html
- Tweaks for PyPy compatibility. Still not compatible yet, however.
- Custom storage support by Mattias (requires libspatialindex 1.7.1)

0.6.0: 2010-04-13
=================

- 0.6.0 relies on libspatialindex 1.5.0+.
- :py:meth:`~rtree.index.Index.intersection` and :py:meth:`~rtree.index.Index.nearest` methods return iterators over results instead of
  lists.
- Number of results for :py:meth:`~rtree.index.Index.nearest` defaults to 1.
- libsidx C library of 0.5.0 removed and included in libspatialindex
- objects="raw" in :py:meth:`~rtree.index.Index.intersection` to return the object sent in (for speed).
- :py:meth:`~rtree.index.Index.count` method to return the intersection count without the overhead 
  of returning a list (thanks Leonard Norrg√•rd).
- Improved bulk loading performance
- Supposedly no memory leaks :)
- Many other performance tweaks (see docs).
- Bulk loader supports interleaved coordinates
- Leaf queries.  You can return the box and ids of the leaf nodes of the index.  
  Useful for visualization, etc.
- Many more docstrings, sphinx docs, etc


0.5.0: 2009-08-XX
=================

0.5.0 was a complete refactoring to use libsidx - a C API for libspatialindex.
The code is now ctypes over libsidx, and a number of new features are now
available as a result of this refactoring.

* ability to store pickles within the index (clustered index)
* ability to use custom extension names for disk-based indexes
* ability to modify many index parameters at instantiation time
* storage of point data reduced by a factor of 4
* bulk loading of indexes at instantiation time
* ability to quickly return the bounds of the entire index
* ability to return the bounds of index entries
* much better windows support 
* libspatialindex 1.4.0 required.
